# HealthLogix

This is just a basic app to demo my skills. 
UI: React.js
Backend: .net framework MVC controllers 4.6.1
Database: SQL Server 18

There is room for big time improvements. 

Improvements:
1. The UI can be made much prettier if I had time.
2. Authentication - I could have used the basic AuthenticaionHandler class available. I have been using something similar to that at work, so I wanted to create a custom authentication scheme, a very simple one. This excludes the authorization and authenticaion of the headers in the web requests sent to the controllers (the controllers are exposed to the world). I have used localStorage for sessions on browsers.
3. Redux could have been used for state containers
4. The charts on the activity page could have been done. This took me sometime to built it on react - other available react chart libraries did not seem to work.
5. Homepage and Blog page do not have much of a difference, as I did not understand the diff between them from the doco.
